## Problem Description
What do the [flags](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/fbeb5f9040d62b18878d199cdda2d253/flag.png) mean?
## Writeup
At first, we don't know what to do. But then we remember that this challenge was put in the crypto category, and we can use this flag cipher decoder:

After some tedious decoding, we have our flag:
`picoCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}`
