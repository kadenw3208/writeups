## Problem Description
SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like  `picoCTF{filename}`.  [Captured traffic](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/165/torrent.pcap).
## Writeup
After playing around with the file for a bit, we can't find anything, so we look at the hint, and we come across hint #2:
`You may want to enable BitTorrent protocol (BT-DHT, etc.) on Wireshark. Analyze -> Enabled Protocols`
<br>We can do a quick search for `bt-dht` in our wireshark, and we come across this:

We can see in the bottom right that `info_hash` is a keyword. we do a quick search for the hex value of `hash (68 61 73 68)`. This is what comes up: 
![bruh](https://i.ibb.co/ZVyhLgD/image.png)
Now, with the filter, we can just go through the info hash of each until eventually we will find a file that ends with `.iso` (hint #4). 
<br> `picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}`
