## Problem Description
It seems that another encrypted message has been intercepted. The encryptor seems to have learned their lesson though and now there isn't any punctuation! Can you still crack the cipher?Download the message  [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/114/message.txt).
## Writeup
Now that the punctuation is missing, we aren't sure what to do. But we might as well have the substitution cipher break it one more time, right? We try it, and it actually works!!
