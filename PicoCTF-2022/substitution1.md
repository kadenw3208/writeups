## Problem Description
A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again.Download the message  [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/183/message.txt).
## Writeup
The problem says maybe the same thing would work again, so let's try:
```
CTFs (short for capture the flag) are a type of computer security competition. Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling) skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved, each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service. CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment, and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice. For this problem, the flag is: picoCTF{FR3JU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_6E0659FB}
```
At the very end is our flag:
`picoCTF{FR3JU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_6E0659FB}`
